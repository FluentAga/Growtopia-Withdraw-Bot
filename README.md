# Little Explanation How The Deposit Bot Functions:
- When you'll use http://127.0.0.1:5411/withdraw.php api in any browser it will bring the bot into the save world and get the wls/dls from the api (DLAmount=0&WLAmount=0) and then it will take the amount that was written in the api and then when you'll use http://127.0.0.1:5411/disconnect.php it will go to the world (BotWorld=) and drop the wls/dls if the players name matches with the one in (RGTGrowID=). (1st safe vault is for bgls/dls/, 2nd safe vault is for wls)
